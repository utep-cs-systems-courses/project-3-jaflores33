What this is:
A program that displays my understanding of some significant milestones during
the course. It utilized the lcd screen and input via buttons to change what is
displayed on said screen, as well as other things that carry over from project
2. To go into more verbose detail, this shows that I understand and am able to
utilize the lcd screen to the point of being able to create shapes and fonts
with minimal resources available.

How it works:
Nothing too crazy, there are four buttons and four corresponding displays and
sounds to go with it.
1) White screen with black shape
2) Blue screen with purple shape
3) Red screen with orange shape
4) Yellow screen with green shape
To add, each screen also has the number of its' corresponding button displayed
in black text on a backdrop that matches the color of the shape.

One can go to any display from any display that is currently being shown. and
each button utilizes the buzzer to play a different set of noises.

To go into more detail; switches checks what button is being pressed and
reacts accordingly, and states is the file that regulates what exactly is
going to happen at every button press. It is there the lcd is updated and the
buzzer is utilized.
